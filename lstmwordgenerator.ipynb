Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[15]He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at theSumeet DograAcademy located atVasundhara Enclave.[16]In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[14] On 18 December 2006, Kohli\\'s father died due to acerebral attack.[14][17][11][18]According to his mother, Kohli\\'s demeanour shifted noticeably after his father\\'s death.
