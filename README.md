# Next-Word-Predictor
Using RNN and LSTM methods we create an application capable of taking any wikipedia or any other wiki link , parse the data present on the website through webscrapping and using this data to create a understanding. It then takes user input of a prompt word and generate a sentence for the same based on the website that it has scrapped.
